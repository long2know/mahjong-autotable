// Stuck-turn fix (Hicks) — pure turn-cue resolver.
//
// Extracted so the "your turn / waiting for seat N / spectating / no-open-seat"
// decision is a deterministic pure function covered by a browser-free contract
// test (turn-cue.contract.spec.ts), mirroring hand-accounting.ts.
//
// It resolves the LOW-priority turn banner states (everything AFTER the
// claim-window and pickup affordances, which game-ui.ts handles first).  The
// design goal is to make three things unambiguous, which the shipped bundle
// conflated into a single empty banner:
//   1. It is MY turn to discard   → "Your turn — click a tile to discard".
//   2. It is ANOTHER seat's turn  → "Waiting for Seat N…" (auto-draw + bots
//      are handled server-side; the human just waits, and now SEES that).
//   3. I hold no actionable seat  → distinguish an intentional spectator from
//      landing on an in-progress game whose seats are all taken (the stale-
//      gameId-reuse deadlock: Hudson/Ripley Design Review defect 1) so the UI
//      can offer "New Game" instead of a frozen table + misleading "Not your
//      turn".
//
// Authoritative-first, geometry-as-defence-in-depth: when Bishop's `turn`
// signal is present it wins; the meld-aware geometry heuristic only fills in
// when the signal is absent (older backend) or still in flight.

 * (`activeSeat: null` / `awaitingDiscard: false` on every non-AwaitingDiscard

//
// The turn banner (#turn-banner) is normally a non-interactive status pill:
// `pointer-events: none` in style.css so it never eats clicks meant for the 3D
// table.  For the ONE actionable state (no-open-seat New Game) the banner must
// become genuinely clickable/tappable AND keyboard-operable — which requires
// re-enabling pointer events (Hudson found the shipped attempt was visually
// actionable but DEAD because pointer-events was never overridden).
//
// This pure descriptor is the single source of truth for that state so the
// exact regression ("pointerEvents must be 'auto' when actionable, and reset
// otherwise") is guarded by a browser-free contract test; game-ui.ts applies
// it and binds/unbinds the click + Enter/Space handlers idempotently.
