    // The backend `things` broadcast frequently contains tile-swap
    // pairs and slot-takeover batches where the target slot is still
    // occupied at the start of the batch. Naïvely calling
    // `thing.moveTo(slot)` on those throws "slot not empty"; the old
    // logic guarded against the throw by silently skipping the move
    // (the "skipped stale moveTo" console.warn), which caused the
    // client view to drift away from the authoritative server state.
    // Vasquez's audit counted ~97 dropped moves in 5 minutes of play —
    // dropped moves included legitimate discards, breaking scenarios
    // A (manual discard round-robin), B (bot autoplay), and D (claim
    // window appearance).
    //
    // Earlier iterations had two pre-passes:
    //   (1) `thing.prepareMove()` on every batched thing — nulls the
    //       thing's CURRENT slot pointer.
    //   (2) Force-displace target-slot occupants ONLY when the
    //       occupant is NOT also in the batch, on the assumption that
    //       within-batch occupants were already cleared by pass 1.
    //
    // The assumption broke in the orphan-stale-ownership case:
    //   slot X.thing === Z   AND   Z.slot === some-other-slot
    // where Z's `.slot` was reassigned by a prior moveTo but slot X's
    // `.thing` pointer was never cleared (moveTo only writes
    // target.thing, never sources). When the new batch said
    // [W → X, Z → Y], pass 1 cleared Z.slot.thing (= some-other-slot,
    // NOT X) and pass 2 skipped force-displacing slot X (because Z
    // was "in the batch"). The placement loop then saw X still
    // occupied by Z and silently dropped W's move.
    //
    // Fix:
    //   1a. Pre-vacate every source slot (existing `prepareMove`).
    //   1b. Pre-vacate every target slot whose CURRENT occupant is a
    //       different tile, regardless of whether that tile is in the
    //       batch. Setting `slot.thing = null` is safe — if the
    //       displaced tile has its own batch entry, it will be re-
    //       bound by the placement loop below; if not, it becomes an
    //       orphan that the next UPDATE rebinds (the existing pattern
    //       — see `emitDiscard` orphan handling in this file).
    //   2.  Placement loop still defends against an unreachable
    //       "still occupied" branch with a throttled warning, but
    //       force-clears + places instead of silently skipping. Last-

   * (Pung / Chow / exposed·concealed·added Kong) into the separate `meld`
   * slot group (`ChangshaToAutotableTranslator.BuildThings` →

   * concealed tiles + a meld while the runtime has ALREADY handed it the turn
   * (`ActiveSeat == self`, `Phase == AwaitingDiscard`); the concealed-only
   * count read 11 → false → the sole real discard route (click-to-discard →

   *
   * Correct mahjong hand-size accounting: a "rest" hand is 13 tiles =
   * concealed + 3 per meld — each Kong's 4th physical tile is offset by its

   * 13, which holds for a normal draw (14 + 0) AND every post-meld case
   * (11 + 3, 8 + 6, …).  This reads the authoritative tile state the backend
   * pushed; `TryHandleDiscardActionAsync` stays the authoritative validator,
   * and the `> 13` bound means the intercept only fires on the seat's own
   * turn (a rest hand totals exactly 13), never out of turn.
   *
   * Relay variants (four_player/three_player/bamboo/minefield) have no server
