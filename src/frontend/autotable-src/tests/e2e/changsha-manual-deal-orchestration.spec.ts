// D2 / NEW-1 (revision owner: hicks, 2026-08-11 — stale test-harness revision per
// Hudson's re-review; original harness rejected for not driving the human ceremony).
// A REAL, SEPARATE backend deal-orchestration golden (NOT the R-1 pickup-interaction
// defect — tagged separately so it does not muddy G17). Root (Vasquez, grounded
// @200cad4): ChangshaGameRuntime.StartGameAsync manual branch returned WITHOUT
// scheduling the BOT dealer's dice roll; the bot-dealer roll only fired via
// ScheduleBotIfNeededAsync on hands 2+. So a manual HAND 1 with a BOT dealer parked in
// RollingDice forever (nobody rolled: the bot wasn't scheduled and a non-dealer human's
// blind rollDice is server-rejected) ⇒ no pickup cursor ever targeted the human ⇒ the
// human's hand stayed 0. The product candidate (:18088) SCHEDULES the bot-dealer roll
// for hand-1 manual too, so the non-dealer human now receives their pickup windows.
//
// Acceptance (GREEN on the candidate): a NON-DEALER human (seat 1; the dealer is the
// seat-0 BOT) in a manual deal receives their per-batch pickup windows and, DRIVING
// each owned batch with a real #pickup-take-btn press (never clicking during a bot's
// window), reaches exactly 13 tiles — 4 owned batches [4,4,4,1]; a non-dealer gets NO
// DealerExtra. Then the ceremony pickups for our seat are exhausted. The hand is read
// on the LOCAL seat (world.seat), so the seat-0 BOT dealer's hand filling to 14 can
// NEVER satisfy this vacuously (the prior harness counted `hand.*@0` — the bot dealer's
// seat — and would have passed without the human ever acting). RED@200cad4 stalls (0
// human presses possible: the window never reaches the human).
//
// Discipline: genuine rendered controls only — the human takes each owned batch via the
// real "Take N" HUD button (shared takePickup), pressed ONLY when it is genuinely our
// pickup turn (readIsMyPickupTurn). No emitTakePickup, no synthetic pickup.take, no
// collection injection, no roll backdoor (the bot dealer rolls server-side; the human,
// a non-dealer, never rolls).
