/// <summary>
/// Scoring service for Changsha Mahjong per Vasquez §5.
/// Two tiers:
///   Small Win: self-draw = 2 (each pays 2), discard = 1 from discarder + 2 from dealer/discarder if dealer involved
///   Big Win:   self-draw = 4 (each pays 4), discard = 6 from discarder + 7 if dealer
///
/// Per the spec's payment table (dealer bonus baked in):
///   Small Win self-draw: each other player pays 2 to winner
///   Small Win discard:   discarder pays 2 to winner (1 base + 1 discarder penalty)
///                        BUT if discarder is dealer → pays 2; if winner is dealer → discarder pays 2
///   Big Win self-draw:   each other player pays 4 to winner (3 base + 1 dealer bonus if applicable)
///   Big Win discard:     discarder pays 6 to winner (non-dealer) or 7 (dealer involved)
///
/// Simplified scoring table from spec:
///   Small Win = 1/2 → non-dealer discard = 1, self-draw per player = 2
///   Big Win   = 6/7 discard, 3/4 self-draw
///
/// Payment interpretation:
///   Small Win discard:   discarder pays 1 (non-dealer→non-dealer), 2 (dealer involved)
///   Small Win self-draw: each pays 2
///   Big Win discard:     discarder pays 6 (non-dealer→non-dealer), 7 (dealer involved)
///   Big Win self-draw:   each pays 3 (non-dealer→non-dealer), 4 (dealer involved)
///
/// Phase H Wave 2 — Big Win stacking multiplier (per Ripley's design memo §2.3),
/// gated OFF by default since issue #117 (spec §5.1 has NO stacking table):
///   Big Win patterns simultaneously satisfied → multiplier on base Big Win payment:
///     1 pattern  →  ×1 (spec-pure baseline; the default the live path passes)
///     2 patterns →  ×2
///     3+ patterns →  ×3 (cap)
///   The multiplier is a pure capability of this service (still exercised directly by
///   unit tests and by the opt-in <see cref="ChangshaScoringOptions.HouseRules"/> mode).
///   The live <see cref="ChangshaGameStateMachine.Score"/> path passes
///   <c>bigWinPatternCount = 1</c> unless house-rule stacking is enabled, so spec §5.1
///   magnitudes hold by default. Small Wins never stack.
