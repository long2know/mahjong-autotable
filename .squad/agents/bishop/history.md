# Project Context

- **Owner:** Stephen Long
- **Project:** Changsha-first Mahjong game built from pwmarcz/autotable, with expanded Chinese rules planned
- **Stack:** .NET 10 backend, EF Core + SQLite initially, optional React + Fluent UI 9 + TypeScript + Vite frontend modernization, single-image Docker deployment
- **Created:** 2026-04-20

## Learnings

- Team initialized with Bishop as Backend Dev.
- Backend priorities: game state APIs, rule engine interfaces, and provider-flexible persistence.
- Added initial bot-play backend slice: 4-seat typed table state (human/bot), table create/get APIs, and deterministic bot advance endpoint with persisted `StateJson` + `StateVersion` for extensibility.
- Added backend unit tests around bot state engine behavior to lock current deterministic placeholder semantics while rules engine work remains pending.
- Replaced placeholder bot mutation with an authoritative draw/discard loop backed by seeded wall state, per-seat hands, discard pile tracking, and phase-aware turn semantics.
- Added strict human discard validation endpoint and routed bot advancement through the same discard application path to keep server authority and invariants aligned.
- Added action-sequence/state-version progression rules, canonical state hashing, and structured contract error responses (including optimistic concurrency conflicts) for discard and bot orchestration endpoints.
- Added replay verification support that re-simulates accepted discard actions from stored seed and compares canonical state hashes for deterministic integrity checks.
- Added durable append-only `TableSessionEvents` persistence, event-stream retrieval API, and state-hash stamping on emitted actions to improve replay/integrity auditability.
