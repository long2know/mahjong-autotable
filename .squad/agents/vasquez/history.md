# Project Context

- **Owner:** Stephen Long
- **Project:** Changsha-first Mahjong game built from pwmarcz/autotable, with expanded Chinese rules planned
- **Stack:** .NET 10 backend, EF Core + SQLite initially, optional React + Fluent UI 9 + TypeScript + Vite frontend modernization, single-image Docker deployment
- **Created:** 2026-04-20

## Learnings

- Team initialized with Vasquez as Rules Engineer.
- Rule priorities: Changsha wall/draw behavior, turn transitions, and compatibility seams for expanded Chinese rules.
- Current repository state is scaffolding-only; `RuleSet = changsha` exists, but no executable game-state machine or action arbitration yet.
- Bot readiness requires one authoritative pipeline for human and bot actions, plus seat-scoped state privacy and replayable deterministic logs.
- Changsha implementation should be frozen as a versioned profile (`changsha-v1`) with explicit ambiguity list before coding transitions.
